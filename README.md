# Replication 3: "The Political Legacy of American Slavery"

This repository includes replication of the code used to build two tables and most figures from the Acharya, Blackwell, and Sen article "The Political Legacy of American Slavery.”

All data and replication code were obtained from: 
https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/CAEEG7

Note: In order to run this replication code, one must manually download and run the files “abs-jop-ind.csv” and the “usa-00015.csv” from the dataverse as they were too large to commit.
